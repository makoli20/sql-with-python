# sql-with-python

I turn a csv file into a table in a postgreSQL database and query it using Python.
I perform DML and DDL operations in SQL
The csv file - coffeeshop.csv

After the database is created in postgreSQL, I analyse data to answer the following using SQL -
1. Find the minimum , maximum and average salaries overall.
2. Find employees with missing emails.
3. Identify shops where the average salary is above the company-wide average salary
4. Ranking Employees by Salary Within Each Shop using Window function
5. # Order by the average salary per shop ascending
